### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Chris.

### - ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a certificate in Python and beefing of my Power BI skills.

### - ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development and Design principles, along with some German on the side.

### - ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my past travels and future plans. I recently came back from two weeks in Chile.

### - ğŸ“« How to reach me: let's connect at www.linkedin.com/in/dillardchristopher 

### - âš¡ Fun facts: I am a triple citizen of the US, UK, and Germany and have previously lived in Spain, por lo que tambiÃ©n hablo espaÃ±ol :) I love learning new recipes almost as much as the food and can play the Piano, Saxophone (thanks to marching band), and almost the Violin.
